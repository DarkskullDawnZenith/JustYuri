Concerns

Q: The start up warning says that I should expect NSFW content; I'm under 18, should I still be playing this?
A: As of writing the game is currently mostly SFW and the warning is there for the future planned 18+ content; the content within depending on player actions can be the disturbing psychological horror, messed up stuff that you can come to expect from the DDLC base game. There is no adult imagery in the base Just Yuri game. There will be a hard NSFW patch available for those interested in that sort of thing when that is developed.

Q:In the start up of the game it warns that I'll be expecting a lot of messed-up NSFW content and that Yuri can even take over my computer! Is this a virus?
A:No, the Just Yuri mod is like any other DDLC mod and follows Dan's guidelines and is safe to run on your computer; it's not a virus. The warning is more or less to give you a expectation that sudden computer changes might be caused due to your interaction with Yuri and not some outside factor. Please do not be alarmed if your browser automatically redirects you to certain websites and videos while the mod is running. This is normal operation and should be expected... at some point in the game.

Q:Can Yuri really access my webcam?
A:No, not as of Beta 1.10.3 but, she will be able to in future builds ;) 
This feature will be optional

Q:How does Karma and Sanity affect things? Can it drive Yuri to kill herself? ;-;
A:Just dialogue currently as of writing, other uses soon :)

Known Issues

Q:Yuri saying there's something wonderful in her file and is requesting me to change her character file, should I? I heard that if it is changed to a .txt file, the game deletes her. How do I avoid that while still doing what she wants me to do?
A: If this is still an issue please report this to #bug-reporting and copy the yuri.chr file, and paste it to to your desktop, and change that one on your desktop to a .txt. 
 
Q:My computer has messed up Yuri's character file and turned it into a .png file somehow. Now my computer thinks I deleted the file, how do I solve this?! Can I recover Yuri?!
A:Close the game and rename her character file back to Yuri.chr and relaunch the game. If that didn't work, delete the persistent file located at %appdata%\RenPy\Just Yuri and delete the firstrun file in the game folder of your DDLC install location. Note: this will reset the game and Yuri with it. If that didn't work either, tell us on the Discord group in #bug-reporting.

Common Suggestions

NOTE: Before making any suggestions, please refer to the suggestions list already posted onto our discord group in the #jy-game-suggestions section, and if a suggestion you like is already listed, simply up vote that suggestion.


S:Yuri should go to (x) place with the player and do (y).
A:We have many, many suggestions of where/what Yuri could be doing with the player. As of right now, we are only focusing on what she can be doing in the space classroom and the library (aka at the desk). More content is coming soon, including different places to interact with Yuri. Until that is released, please hold on to these suggestions!

S:You should get (x) artist to do (y) art of Yuri for the game!
A:While we already have put out requests to see if several known artists will volunteer to help us, sadly, getting a particular artist on board requires commissioning them which can cost a lot of money.
While we have hired on one or two artists, this is an exception and not the rule as they are drawing up our NSFW content and we are looking for only the best for Yuri.
If you strongly believe that you have found a talented relatively unknown artist that you know would be potentially interested in doing art for the mod, drop us a suggestion and we may consider contacting them.

S:You should set up a Patreon or Kofi for the devs so they can get paid! Stop slave driving people, you meanie!
A:This project is non-profit, and tries to stay being a mostly volunteer project. We are currently considering starting a fund for hiring additional devs, though there is the current fear that money would give general credence to antagonistic criticism against them, for being obligated to put aside IRL responsibilities, due to being directly financed for the mod. We would like to avoid this by staying a mostly volunteer project.

S:You should add an in-game day/night cycle like MAS, instead of a permanent space background.
A:The idea's already been implemented in the public build but locked behind dev tools for the moment :)
 
S:You should have Yuri to celebrate holidays when they occur, like Christmas and stuff.
A:We've implemented this idea for April Fools and the Winter Holiday Season. Additional holiday celebrations may be added in due time. 

S:At random points, you should have Yuri come up with something she needs to do based on data such as Holiday/Special event/ "Player's Birthday" to where she says something and tell the "player" she has something she must do for a while followed by crashing the game and not allowing it to restart for a few mins or so giving the idea that she is putting something together for a celebration with "Player" [the time not allowed to play would give the feel that she is busy doing stuff]
A:We are working on this. 

S:If possible, I think there should be a high / middle / and low sanity, instead of just sanity; the same goes for Karma. I suggest this because Yuri acts too crazy at low Sanity and acts way too normal at 100 Sanity or higher.
A: We have already implemented this suggestion, and are further experimenting with the sanity and karma system being more complex and dynamic in dev builds :) ; but, yes, currently the public builds values can be out of balance and we are fine tuning it as we go.
 
S:The sanity system could use some improvement beyond adding and subtracting a value. Some of the initial sanity event triggers are way too low and could be adjusted alongside a fix that uses a small mathematical formula for negative sanity values as positive sanity values also set it off.
A:This suggestion will be added in the future, and again we are further experimenting with the sanity and karma system being more complex and dynamic for future builds.

General Questions and Answers
Q: I have a general question about the mod not covered here! Who do I bring this up to?
A: First, be sure to review this whole FAQ. If you still are unable to find an answer to your question, please refer to our discord #jy-game-chat channel where members of the community maybe able to answer your question or contact someone on your behalf who is available to better assist. In addition, pinging @Leads should also bring in our representatives, who may direct you to the person best suited to answer your mod question.

Q:How often is the mod updated?
A: Depends on the team and their free time.
Refer to our Discord's #mod-updates for updates on production and plans
 
Q: WHEN IS THE NEXT UPDATE!? I MUST HAVE THE NEWEST EDITION!!
A:Notifications of public updates and progress can be found in #mod-updates in our Discord or hints at progress are sometimes leaked by certain people in #jy-leeksoup
If you are looking to get access to the very latest (unstable and buggy) dev builds, you might consider bug testing for us by applying for the Verified Contributor Role.
The Verified Contributors role is a special role for people who gain early access, bug test and generally help the developers on a regular basis..
Note: This is a closed bug testing and each applicant is screened before hand and may or may not be denied the Verified Contributor role.


Looking to be a Verified Contributor?
Know that the Verified Contributor position has requirements. You would need to be active very often and it consists of testing and doing odd jobs for the devs such as making documents, recording a bunch, basically helping out wherever you can on an almost daily basis. If you still think that's something up your alley fill out the form on our discord in #information-i or ping the Verified Contributor Supervisor role in #jy-game-chat for an interview and we may or may not admit you
 
Q:I'm looking to update my game to the latest version, what should I do? Do I have to copy the new files into my game ? If so... can I accidentally harm Yuri \ my save while doing so?
A:Download the latest release and extract everything into whatever location your Just Yuri copy is.

Q:If I copy the folder with the mod on a pendrive/thumbdrive, will I be able to save my progress with Yuri?
A:Yes, the Just Yuri Persistent file saves the game progress. Located in %appdata%\RenPy\Just Yuri

Q:I'm using a downloaded DDLC at the moment as the Steam version will not open. How do I find the appdata aka save data location for DDLC?
A:

For Windows users:

Press the Windows key + R simultaneously to open the "Run" dialog box.
Type %appdata%\RenPy into the text box and press Enter or click OK.
This will open the Ren'Py folder within your AppData\Roaming directory. Inside, you'll find folders for different Ren'Py games and mods you have played. The original DDLC save folder is typically named DDLC-1454445547.

macOS users:

Open Finder.
Click on "Go" in the menu bar at the top of the screen.
Hold down the Option (⌥) key. You should see "Library" appear in the dropdown menu. Click on "Library". (The Library folder is hidden by default).
Alternatively, while Finder is open, press Command (⌘) + Shift + G to open the "Go to Folder" dialog.
Type ~/Library/RenPy/ into the text box and click "Go".
This will open the Ren'Py folder where save data for DDLC and its mods are stored. The original DDLC save folder is usually DDLC-1454445547.

Linux users:

Open your File Manager.
Navigate to your Home directory.
You need to show hidden files. You can usually do this by pressing Ctrl + H or finding an option in the View menu (like "Show Hidden Files").
Look for a folder named .renpy.
Alternatively, open a Terminal and type cd ~/.renpy/ and press Enter. You can then use ls to list the contents or open the folder in your file manager (e.g., using xdg-open . or nautilus . depending on your environment).
Inside the .renpy folder, you will find the save data folders for DDLC (usually DDLC-1454445547) and any mods.
 
Q:I want to help! Can I be the coder, artist, etc., of the mod?
A:Yes,If you have skills, you can. Enter our discord server and there you can ask @Moderator for the applications.

If you don't really have the skills to develop, you can look to being a Verified Helper to take care of odd jobs and documentation for the Devs and server staff such as this FAQ

Q:I have an idea for dialogue for Just Yuri. Is there any format I should use?
A:There is a preferred format, namely this:


# This is how you do a comment
```
label idle_[insert number here]:
   mc "This is how to make MC talk."
   "This is how to do internal narration for MC."
   y "This is how to make Yuri talk."
```

# How to process Karma or Sanity into marker values.
Values for sanity and karma levels:
```
Very High karma_lvl() and/or sanity_lvl() == 5
High      karma_lvl() and/or sanity_lvl() == 4
Neutral   karma_lvl() and/or sanity_lvl() == 3
Low       karma_lvl() and/or sanity_lvl() == 2
Very Low  karma_lvl() and/or sanity_lvl() == 1
```

# How to process Karma or Sanity points.
Dialogue example.
```
   y "Sorry for talking too much [player]."
   menu:
      "It's okay [persistent.yuri_nickname], I enjoy talking with you.":
         karma 5  #Or any other value that is between 1 to 10
         sanity 5 #Or any other value that is between 1 to 10
         y "Thank you [player]."

      "No hard feelings [persistent.yuri_nickame], but don't you get tired of talking too much?":
         karma -5  #Or any other value that is between -1 to -10
         sanity -5 #Or any other value that is between -1 to -10
         y "Y-you're right [player], I apologize."
  ```

   # You have to define the sanity/karma level into a marker value first before using it in if statements like so: (THE $ IS VERY IMPORTANT SINCE THE persistent module [The module that helps store persistent data] only works in the context of python)
   Next, you can specify unique dialogue according to different sanity/karma values
   ```
   if karma_lvl() >= 3:
      y "This is a High Karma decision"
   elif sanity_lvl() >= 3:
      y "This is a High Sanity decision"
   else:
      y "If not High Karma or Sanity, play this dialogue instead."

   y "This dialogue is the same regardless of Karma, and happens after both Karma options"
   menu:
      "This is now a menu prompt, and this text here shows up below the menu options"
      "Menu Option 1":
         y "This is the dialogue of the first menu option"
      "Menu Option 2":
         # this is how to allow the dialogue option to skip to the next reconnecting branch
         $pass
   y "This dialogue connects both options back into a single pathway"
   #include this at the bottom to jump back to Yuri waiting for you to respond after talking in the idle
   jump ch30_loop
```
