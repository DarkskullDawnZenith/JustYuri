*yupee time of day sprite bug - being worked on by chronks

*"whats your favorite weather?" conversation - always insanity variant  bug/coding typo - just needs a code correction of "hogh" to "High" to fix

*karma and sanity are NOT being modified per conversion as expected,  only on certain few deep involved conversations, possible bug?

*when attempting to play the game with no audio devices enabled, it just crashes to a traceback telling you "no audio". - need this to be handled by the game with out it crashing

* " i love you" active bug - when asking with no karma or insanity Yuri does not reply to question and active closes
*also when player has + karma,  it appears to use a negative karma response as mc kinda acts uncertain and Yuri questions the players statement

*random outro/goodbye bug? - outro/goodbyes appear to be random -
        - saying goodbye at neutral 0 karma and insanity game appers to be pulling from low karma / high insanity goodbyes
the "im gonna ..close the game now" goodbye. 
and
"oh! look at the time!" goodbye which appears to be a high insanity 
goodbye

- saying goodbye at high karma and low insanity occasionaly has these goodbyes as well
